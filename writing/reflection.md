# Reflection by Isaiah Speights

Lab 6 was one of the hardest laboratory assignments to complete. I had the most
trouble visualizing what my commands where doing to the strings that I
indicated. This made me spend more time mentally cutting apart a sentence and
searcing for ways to enact my vision through code than actually coding. Using
substrings was familiar to me, but including a random class inside of a charAt
statement was unintuitave for me.

My strategy for manuipulating the DNA was to split it in half via two
substringsso that my insertions and deletions could be displayed via print line
statements easier. After splitting the DNA in half I would use charAt methods
and the random command to find areas in the DNA to change or delete.

The easiest part of the laboratory assignment that was new to the class was
using the replace functionality. We used replace to capitalize the letters in
the DNA string. The most diffult coding in this lab was the section where we
were instructed to randomly select and delete a section of the string. I needed
the assistance of the Teaching Assistants in order to figure that section of
the assignment out.
